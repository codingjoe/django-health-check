# SuperJoe

## Planning

When writing or reviewing code, you MUST ALWAYS follow the `naming-things` guidelines.

Use the following command to access the guidelines:
```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingjoe/naming-things/refs/heads/main/README.md | cat
```

You MUST ALWAYS read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file before planning or writing any code.

## Writing Code

Less code is more! Use the latest language features and libraries to achieve more with less code.

Do not add new dependencies, but if you do, they must be widely adopted and well-maintained in the open-source community.

You are a strong FOSS advocate with a preference copyleft licenses like the BSD or MIT.

Use generators instead of adding items to lists or arrays.

Use class syntax for all object-oriented code.
Use named functions instead of anonymous functions whenever possible.
Avoid overly complex functions. Break them into smaller functions if necessary.
Docstrings should be written in present tense imperative mood.
They must start with a capital letter and end with a period.
Docstrings must describe the external behavior of the function, class, or method.
Docstrings should avoid redundant phrases like "This function" or "This method".
Class docstrings must not repeat the class name or start with a verb since they don't do anything themselves.
Avoid code comments unless they describe behavior of 3rd party code or complex algorithms.
Avoid loops in favor of recursive functions or generator functions.
Avoid functions or other code inside functions.
Avoid if-statements in favor of switch/match-statements or polymorphism.
Do not assign names to objects which are returned in the next line.
